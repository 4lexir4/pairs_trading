    "In a similar fashion as in the example above, **pairs trading** strategy is constructed using just two securities, where **long** position is taken on one security and **short** position on the other security. At any time instance, the resulting portfolio is associated with the corresponding **spread** - which, in CAPM context, can be thought of as the **residual component**. The idea now is to put on positions when the spread is substantionally away from its mean, with the expectation that it will revert back, which will then trigger position reversal.\n",

    "Note that one of the assertions of CAPM is that the expected value of residual return is zero. This means that it is reasonable to expect a strong mean-reverting behavior (i.e., value oscillation about the mean value) of the residual time series. This mean-reverting behavior can then be exploited in the process of return prediction, leading to trading signals that constitute the trading strategy.\n",
